# Chip Designer Copilot Agent

🚀 A powerful AI Copilot for chip designers featuring different Agentic pattern multimodal reasoning (using Agno), multi-agent collaboration (using CrewAI), and advanced agentic workflows (using LangGraph). Designed for seamless integration into design tools, canvases, and workspaces.

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

This project demonstrates three major AI integration patterns:

- **🔍 Multimodal Reasoning (Agno)**: Handle both text and visual inputs.
- **🤖 Multi-Agent Systems (CrewAI)**: Specialized agents work collaboratively on chip design tasks.
- **🧭 Agentic Workflows (LangGraph)**: Declarative graphs define task flows; includes a chatbot that can plug directly into any chip design UI/canvas.
