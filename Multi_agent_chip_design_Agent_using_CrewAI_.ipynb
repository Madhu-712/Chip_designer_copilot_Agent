        "\n",

        "Copilot would observe what the engineer is working on to provide a more relevant answer. Traditionally, the engineer would research answers on software manuals , seek advice from an experienced co-worker, or even call on an applications engineer—all of which takes much more time and effort.\n",
        "\n",
        "Copilot will be able to provide prescriptive guidance and recommendations and also create workflow scripts. For example, it might help with debug, identify the worst timing path and provide a suggestion to fix it, or offer a script to apply to a particular cell to optimize for power. What’s more, these results could be served up in just minutes.This Copilot is helping the engineer to get the job done faster."
